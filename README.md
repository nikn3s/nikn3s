- 👋 Hi, I’m @nikn3s, a 15 (almost 16) year old guy from the UK 😎, fascinated by ever-evolving tech industry.
- 👀 I’m intrigued by the developing world around me. I love reading, photography and learning new iteresting skills and concepts in certain sectors.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on python projects, and learning Kivy - python libary for building cross-platform applications. In the near future, I want to renew my  journey with C (I only know how to print hello world, lol), and begin learning Solidity as I heard that it is used 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... (stay tuned..)
- 📫 You can contact me via either Instagram (@nikoattheway), or Discord (nikn3s#8724).
